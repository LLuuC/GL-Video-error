# GL-Video-error
Hi! I'm trying to open video files on processing in my Raspberry Pi 3 but it's saying all the time that my GL Video isn't found. Even if i already install everything... I'm a beginner in this could you help me? Here is the error: GLVideo: source: Resource not found. Debugging information: gstfilesrc.c(535): gst_file_src_start (): /GstPlayBin:playbin0/GstURIDecodeBin:uridecodebin0/GstFileSrc:source: No such file "/usr/local/lib/processing-3.4/B.mp4" GLVideo: source: GStreamer error: state change failed and some element failed to post a proper error message with the reason for the failure.
